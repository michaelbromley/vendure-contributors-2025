After months of development and testing, we're proud to present the new Dashboard:\r\n\r\n- Built on a modern, dev- & AI-friendly stack: React, Tailwind, Shadcn/ui, TanStack Router, Vite\r\n- Customizations that took you hours can now be done in minutes\r\n- Vastly expanded customization options\r\n- User settings persist per logged-in administrator\r\n\r\n→ 🔴 [Dashboard Announcement Video](https://youtu.be/qvbk5j220ho)\r\n→ [Dashboard Getting Started Guide](https://docs.vendure.io/guides/extending-the-dashboard/getting-started/)\r\n→ [Dashboard Demo](https://demo.vendure.io/admin)\r\n→ [Dashboard Component Library](https://storybook.vendure.io)\r\n\r\n## CLI Improvements\r\n\r\n### New `schema` Command\r\n\r\nThe Vendure CLI now has a brand-new `schema` command which allows you to generate a full GraphQL schema for your Admin or Shop API in a single command. No more custom scripts or reliance on running servers. The command reads your VendureConfig and is able to construct the full schema - including all custom fields and API extensions defined in your plugins - and outputs in the format of your choice.\r\n\r\nThe resulting schema can then be used by GraphQL tooling like your IDE's GraphQL plugin to give you perfect autocomplete while you build your queries and mutations.\r\n\r\n→ [Vendure CLI schema command docs](https://docs.vendure.io/guides/developer-guide/cli/#the-schema-command)\r\n\r\n### Improved monorepo support\r\n\r\nA number of improvements have been made to the CLI internals to better handle different types of repo setup. For example, the CLI is now smarter at detecting Nx-like setups which have multiple inherited tsconfig files, where a base config defines path m",

This opens up the CLI to scripting and integrations such as Nx generators.\r\n\r\n[CLI non-interactive mode docs](https://docs.vendure.io/guides/developer-guide/cli/#non-interactive-mode)\r\n\r\n## Settings Store\r\n\r\nWe introduced a brand-new API into Vendure core - the Settings Store. This is a native way to store configuration settings for your plugins via a fast, simple, and feature-rich API.\r\n\r\nIn fact, we already use this API to power our new Dashboard: your user settings get persisted to the settings store, so that they persist across browsers and devices.\r\n\r\n[Settings Store docs](https://docs.vendure.io/guides/developer-gui",

This means you can try it out to get a feel for how it will work, and even run in in parallel to the existing Admin UI. Most create, read, update and delete actions are in place, but bear in mind that this version is far from complete and not yet production-ready.\r\n\r\nYou can try it out for yourself locally:\r\n\r\n1. Install `@vendure/dashboard`\r\n2. Create a `vite.config.mts` file in the root of your project with the following content:\r\n   ```ts\r\n   import {vendureDashboardPlugin} from '@vendure/dashboard/plugin';\r\n   import {pathToFileURL} from 'url';\r\n   import {defineConfig} from 'vite';\r\n\r\n   export default defineConfig({\r\n     plugins: [\r\n        vendureDashboardPlugin({\r\n            vendureConfigPath: pathToFileURL('./src/vendure-config.ts'),\r\n            adminUiConfig: {apiHost: 'http://localhost', apiPort: 3000},\r\n        }),\r\n      ],\r\n   });\r\n   ```\r\n3. Run `npx vite` from your project root.\r\n\r\n### Public demo\r\n\r\nYou can also find a public demo here: https://react.demo.vendure.io/login\r\n\r\nusername: `admin`, password: `admin`\r\n\r\n### Next steps with the Dashboard\r\n\r\nOur next target is a beta release, in around 1 month from now. In this time we'll be concentrating on:\r\n\r\n- The APIs for extending the dashboard with your own custom functionality\r\n- Theming and branding\r\n- Internationalization\r\n\r\n## All major dependencies updated\r\n\r\nThis release updates all major dependencies:\r\n\r\n- NestJS v11\r\n- Express v5\r\n- TypeScript v5.8.2\r\n- Angular v19\r\n- TypeORM v0.3.21\r\n\r\n### Performance improvements\r\n\r\nThese updates include some performance-oriented changes that you can now benefit from:\r\n\r\n- NestJS 11 features a [faster application startup](https://trilon.io/blog/announcing-nestj",
